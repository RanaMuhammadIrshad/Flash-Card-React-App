# Flash-Card-React-App

Create a React flashcard app that consists of two components: a card editor for creating and deleting cards, and a card viewer for viewing the front and the back of the cards. Each component has a button for switching to the other component. Clicking on a card in the card viewer flips the card. The card editor should have a header, a table with a row for each card, and 3 columns: one for the front of the cards, one for the back of the cards, and one for a button to delete the card. It should also have 2 input fields (one for entering text for the front of the card and one for entering text for the back of the card) and an "Add Card" button that adds the card to the list of cards.

## Bonus

For each card, add a button to edit the card.
